# movie_dashboard_with_airflow_etl
This project is a real-time trending movies dashboard using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to fetch data from the TMDB API, transform it, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. Built with Streamlit, it offers an up-to-date view of trending movies, genres, ratings, and descriptions, with daily updates via an automated Airflow pipeline
